To translate characters:

```bash

```

**32. What does `echo` do in shell?**
It displays messages or variable values.

**33. What is the difference between `$0`, `$1`, `$@`, `$#`?**

* `$0` : script name
* `$1` : first argument
* `$@` : all arguments
* `$#` : number of arguments

**34. What is `exit` used for?**
To exit from a script or program.

**35. What is a comment in shell scripting?**
Starts with `#`, used to explain code.

**36. How do you write multiline comments?**
Using `: <<'END'` syntax:

```bash
: <<'END'
This is
a multiline comment
END
```

**37. What is a function in shell scripting?**
Reusable block of code:

```bash

  echo "Hello $1"
}
greet "User"
```

**38. What does `local` mean in a function?**
It limits the variable scope to the function only.

**39. How do you redirect output to a file?**

fi
```
