## Docker Hub Notes

### ✅ Docker Hub Repositories 

**Docker Hub** is a **cloud-based registry** provided by Docker Inc. for storing, sharing, and distributing **Docker container images**.

#### 🔹 Key Features:

1. Allows users to **push and pull Docker images** using:

   * `docker push`
   * `docker pull`

2. Each **repository** can hold **multiple image versions**, labeled with different **tags**.

3. Repositories can be:

   * **Public** (open to everyone)
   * **Private** (restricted to specific users)

#### 🔹 Benefits:

* Enables **easy sharing of container images** with teams, customers, or the community.
* **Lightweight and portable** images allow consistent deployment across multiple systems.
* Supports **collaboration**, **standardization**, and **continuous deployment pipelines**.

#### 📘 Summary :

> Docker Hub repositories are used to **store and share Docker images**. Users can **push images** to a repository and **pull them** on any system, making deployment consistent and portable. They support **version control** through tags and can be public or private.

---

### ✅ Exploring Docker Hub

**Docker Hub** is Docker’s official **cloud-based container image registry**. It allows users to **search, download, store, and share Docker container images**.

#### 🔹 Key Ways to Explore:

* **Web Interface**:

  * Visit [hub.docker.com](https://hub.docker.com)
  * Search images by **name, tag, or description**
  * View image details, tags, pull commands, etc.

* **Command-line Tools**:

  * `docker pull <image>` – download image
  * `docker push <image>` – upload image
  * Available in the open-source Docker engine

---

### ✅ Docker Hub Organizations for Teams

Docker Hub supports **organizations**, which are groups for **collaborative image sharing**.

#### 🔹 Features of Organizations:

* **Repositories** can be shared among members
* Teams can be created within organizations
* **Roles and privileges** can be assigned:

  * **Read**: View images
  * **Write**: Upload/update images
  * **Admin**: Manage settings and users

#### 📘 Example Use Case:

> A company creates a Docker Hub **organization** for its dev team. Devs are divided into **teams** like backend, frontend, and QA. Each team gets access to specific **repositories** with controlled privileges.

#### 📘 Summary :

> Docker Hub allows users to explore, pull, and push Docker images via web or CLI. For collaboration, Docker Hub organizations and teams enable shared access with role-based control, streamlining container image management in teams.

### ✅ Types of Docker Hub Repositories

A **Docker Hub repository** is a storage space where **Docker images** are stored and shared.

#### 🔹 Types of Repositories:

| Type        | Description                                                                     |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Public**  | Visible to everyone, searchable even without a Docker account.                  |
| **Private** | Accessible **only** to users with explicit permission, not publicly searchable. |

* You can **change** a repository from **private to public** or vice versa at any time.
* When making a repo **public**, ensure your code is properly **licensed**. Docker Hub doesn't check licenses automatically.

#### 🔧 Working with Repositories:

* Use **web interface** to browse/search repositories.
* Use the **Docker CLI** to manage images:

  * `docker search <name>` – finds images by name/description
  * `docker pull` / `docker push` – download/upload images

#### 📘 Example:

> A development team stores internal project images in a **private repository** and shares open-source tools via a **public repository**.

#### 📘 Summary :

> Docker Hub repositories can be **public or private**, allowing controlled access to Docker images. Images can be searched using the **web interface** or CLI (`docker search`). Licensing responsibility lies with the image uploader.

---

### ✅ Official Repositories in Docker Hub

**Official repositories** on Docker Hub are **curated and verified images** provided by Docker for widely used applications and services.

#### 🔹 Key Features:

* Marked as **"official"** to indicate **trusted, secure, and maintained** images.
* Examples: `nginx`, `mysql`, `ubuntu`, `node`, etc.
* Maintained by **Docker or upstream developers** with **extra security and quality checks**.

#### 🔹 Security & Trust:

* Docker performs **provenance checks**, **code audits**, and **vulnerability scanning**.
* Ensures users can **safely pull and run** containers in production environments.

#### 🔹 Becoming an Official Repository:

* If you maintain a popular project, you can **submit a pull request** to propose it as an official repo.
* Docker decides if your project qualifies.

#### 📘 Summary :

> **Official repositories** are secure, verified, and maintained images for popular software. Ideal for production use, they are curated by Docker and trusted by the community. Developers can apply, but Docker makes the final decision.

### ✅ Docker Push and Docker Pull

Before using `docker push` or `docker pull`, you must **log in to Docker Hub** with:

```bash
docker login
```

You’ll be prompted to enter your **Docker Hub username and password**. This can also work for **private registries** if specified.

#### 🔹 Common Commands:

* **Search images**:

  ```bash
  docker search busybox
  docker search --filter stars=3 busybox
  ```

* **Pull an image** from Docker Hub:

  ```bash
  docker pull <image-name>[:tag]
  # Example
  docker pull nginx:latest
  ```

* **Push an image** to Docker Hub:

  ```bash
  docker push <image-name>[:tag]
  # Push all tags
  docker image push --all-tags registry-host:5000/myname/myimage
  ```

#### 🔹 Tagging:

* Use `docker tag` to label your image before pushing.
* Tags are **optional but recommended** to distinguish versions, features, or branches.
* You can automate tagging during your build process (e.g., tag with version, commit hash).

#### 📘 Summary:

> Use `docker login` to authenticate, then `docker push` and `docker pull` to upload/download container images. Tagging helps version control and team collaboration. CLI also allows image searching using `docker search`.

Here’s a **simple point-wise version** of the topic **“Automated Builds on Docker Hub”** – perfect for your **VC exam** revision:

---

## ✅ **Automated Builds on Docker Hub**

1. **Automated builds** let you **build Docker images automatically** when code changes in a linked repository (e.g., GitHub, Bitbucket).

2. No need to manually push the image to Docker Hub after every code change.

3. Docker Hub watches the **linked repo** (with a Dockerfile) and **auto-builds** the image when updates occur.

4. Useful for **frequently updated projects** (daily/hourly changes).

5. Docker Hub limits:

   * **1 build per repo every 5 minutes**
   * **No support** for Git LFS or Windows containers

6. **Paid accounts** can perform **parallel builds** (e.g., build from 5 different repos at once).

7. Each repo still allows only **one build at a time**.

8. **Webhooks** can be set to trigger actions (e.g., auto-deploy/test) when:

   * Image is rebuilt
   * New tag is added

---

📘 ** Summary**:

> Automated builds in Docker Hub link code repositories with image builds.
> They save time by auto-building containers after code changes.
> Webhooks can be used for auto-deployment or testing.
